Team Name: **Ethereal Elites**

## 💡 Problem Statement

Traditional banking systems restrict access to unsecured loans due to:

- High risk and dependency on credit scores
- High interest rates
- Lack of transparency
- Centralized intermediaries
- Risks associated with fractional reserve lending

## 🌐 Our Solution

A **DeFi-powered lending protocol** that:

- Enables **flash loans**, **under-collateralized**, and **uncollateralized** loans
- Uses a **protocol token** for governance, insurance, and fee discounts
- Implements **on-chain credit scoring** for fair loan eligibility
- Ensures **smart contract-enforced rules** for liquidity and compliance

## 🧱 Key Features

- 🔁 **Flash Loans**: Instant loans with zero collateral, repaid in the same block
- 💸 **Under-Collateralized Lending**: Stake a % amount with time-locked guarantees
- 🧠 **Credit Score Mechanism**: Dynamic, on-chain borrower profiling
- 🛡️ **Insurance Pool**: Funded via protocol tokens to cover defaults

## ⚙️ Tech Stack (Planned)

- **Frontend**: Next.js  
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity  
- **Wallet Integration**: Wagmi  
- **Storage**: IPFS via Pinata (Filecoin optional)  
- **Tokenomics**: Protocol Token + Staking Pool

## 🌍 Core DeFi Principles

- Decentralization  
- Transparency  
- Openness  
- Interoperability  
- Automation via Smart Contracts  
- Insurance against loan failures

## 🎯 Vision

To create an inclusive and resilient decentralized lending ecosystem where users can access credit without traditional barriers, powered by transparency, automation, and community governance.
